# HIT137 Assignment 2 — Team Repository

This repository is for our HIT137 Assignment 2. It has the assignment instructions, input files, code, and outputs that we create as a group.

---

## How we will work together

- **Branches**: Each person makes a branch for the question they are working on (for example `q1-encryption`, `q2-temperature`, `q3-pattern`). When the work is ready it gets pulled back into `main`.
- **Commits**: Keep commits small and write a short message about what changed (like “added starter for Q1” or “finished Q2 outputs”).
- **Issues**: Use Issues to split up the work and leave notes for each other. Tag teammates with @username so they see it.
- **Reviews**: Before code goes into `main`, someone else should check the pull request and approve it.

---

## Communication

- We will use Issues to keep track of tasks and progress.
- Each person should comment on Issues when they finish something or have a problem.
- Meeting notes or extra details can go into Issue comments or into a NOTES.md file if we need one.
