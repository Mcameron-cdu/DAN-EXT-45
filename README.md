## Getting started

1. Create a new private repository on GitHub (if not already done).
2. Download and unzip this starter folder on your computer.
3. In the GitHub repo, go to **Add file → Upload files**.
4. Drag both the `README.md` and the `assignment_files` folder into the upload box.
5. Commit the changes.

If GitHub gives you trouble with folders, press `.` on the repo page to open github.dev (the web VS Code editor) and drag the `assignment_files` folder into the file explorer there. Then commit and push.

## How we will work together

- **Branches**: Each person should create a branch for their part of the work (e.g., `data-cleaning`, `report-draft`) and then open a pull request back to `main`.
- **Commits**: Keep commits small and use clear messages (e.g., “add CSV loader” or “draft analysis section”).
- **Issues**: Use GitHub Issues to assign work and leave notes for each other. Tag team members with @username so they get a notification.
- **Reviews**: At least one other team member should check a pull request before it is merged into `main`.

## Communication

- Start an Issue titled: “Please read the README and check assignment files” so everyone sees the setup.
- Use Issues to track work and progress.
- Meeting notes or extra details can be added as comments in Issues or added as a simple NOTES.md file if needed.

If we use external resources for coding or explanations, we will add the references here in APA 7th format.
