# HIT137 Assignment 2 — Team Repository

This repository is for our HIT137 Assignment 2. It contains the assignment instructions, data, and any code or notes we create as a group.

---

## How we will work together

- **Branches**: Each person should create a branch for their part of the work (e.g., `data-cleaning`, `report-draft`) and then open a pull request back to `main`.
- **Commits**: Keep commits small and use clear messages (e.g., “add CSV loader” or “draft analysis section”).
- **Issues**: Use GitHub Issues to assign work and leave notes for each other. Tag team members with @username so they get a notification.
- **Reviews**: At least one other team member should check a pull request before it is merged into `main`.

---

## Communication

- Use Issues to track work and progress.
- Meeting notes or extra details can be added as comments in Issues or added as a simple NOTES.md file if needed.
